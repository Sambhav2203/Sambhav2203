                                        <li class="mb-2"> Monarchs need mountain forests in Mexico for their winter habitat, however nearby human communities also rely on them and create pressure on forests through agriculture and tourism activities.  In the U.S., monarchs need places to reproduce and feed. However, herbicide use is decreasing the availability of their primary food source, the milkweed plant. </li>
                                        <li class="mb-2"> Climate change threatens to disrupt the monarch butterfly’s annual migration pattern by affecting weather conditions in both wintering grounds and summer breeding grounds. Colder, wetter winters could be lethal to these creatures and hotter, drier summers could shift suitable habitats north. WWF’s 2013 report from Mexico showed that the number of monarch butterflies wintering there was at its lowest in 20 years. </li>

					  <li class="mb-2"> One easy way to help monarchs is to participate in the National Wildlife Federation's Garden for Wildlife program by planting a pesticide-free monarch habitat garden filled with native milkweed and nectar plants. North America has several dozen native milkweed species, with at least one naturally found in any given area.  </li>
                                          <li class="mb-2"> The monarch population has declined by approximately 90 percent since the 1990s. Monarchs face habitat loss and fragmentation in the United States and Mexico. For example, over 90 percent of the grassland ecosystems along the eastern monarch’s central migratory flyway corridor have been lost, converted to intensive agriculture or urban development.  </li>
                                           <li class="mb-2"> Planting locally native species is the best option for helping monarchs because monarchs coevolved with native plants and their life cycles are in sync with each other. In the last decade tropical milkweed (Asclepias curassavica), a plant not native to the United States, has become an increasingly popular way to attract monarchs in garden settings.  </li>

                            <p> Monarch butterflies are native to North and South America, but they’ve spread to other warm places where milkweed grows. No longer found in South America, monarchs in North America are divided into two main groups: The western monarchs, which breed west of the Rocky Mountains and overwinter in southern California; and the eastern monarchs, which breed in the Great Plains and Canada, and overwinter in Central Mexico. There are also populations in Hawaii; Portugal and Spain; and Australia, New Zealand, and elsewhere in Oceania.  </p>

			    <h2 class="title"> Case Study  </h2>
                            <p> The students had spent the morning walking along the Lakefront Trail, swapping stories about their first semester in college, and enjoying the sights and sounds of their hometown of Chicago. They felt fortunate that they had been able to coordinate a long weekend home together, allowing them to catch up and take a break from their studies. Before Chris could get out a well-planned comeback, however, a group of butterflies caught Morgan’s attention. The two spent a few minutes researching monarch butterfly migration on Wikipedia on their phones (Morgan made a mental note to tell her biology professor that there were some good uses for smartphones).  </p>
