					  <li class="mb-2"> Some of the important desirable attributes of fisheries management are the precautionary approach, the ecosystem approach, adaptive management and participatory decision- making. The major difficulty is that few of the major humphead wrasse exporting countries have much functional management for small-scale commercial fisheries, not to mention these more sophisticated concepts. </li>
                                          <li class="mb-2"> In October 2004 the humphead wrasse was listed on Appendix II of CITES. International trade of species on this list is permitted only if the export will not be detrimental to the survival of the species in the wild. For fishes, this has generally been interpreted to mean that in the exporting country there must be a functional management plan and associated monitoring.  </li>

			    <h2 class="title"> Places Found in Abundance and location  </h2>
                            <p> The humphead wrasses can be located with in the east coast of Africa and Red Sea's ocean, as well as in the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean Tuamoto Islands, north to the Ryukyu Islands, and south to New Caledonia. Juvenile and adult humphead wrasses are found in different ranges. Juveniles are usually found in shallow, sandy ranges that are bordering coral reef waters, while adults are mostly found in offshore and deeper areas of the coral reefs, typically in outer-reef slopes and channels, but can also be found in lagoons. </p>

			    <h2 class="title"> Case Study </h2>
                            <p> The population dynamics model is used to determine th ree relationships: (1) between the rate of fishing mortality in the wild and the expected catch (in the wild and from caged animals); (2) between the rate of fishing mortality in the wild and the reduction in population size (measured by, for example, total female biomass, or egg production), and (3) between the rate of fishing mortality in the wild and the sex-ratio (M:F) of mature animals. The modelling and estim ation framework is tailored to a protog ynous hermaphrodite as well as to th e specifics of the fishery for humphead wrasse in Indonesia. Specifically, the number of males depends on the number of fem ales and the rate of s ex-change, while allowance is also made for size-specific fishing selectivity and grow-out of caged animals.  </p>
