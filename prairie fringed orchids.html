				    <ul class="mb-5">
					  <li class="mb-2">Herbicide and pesticide use in farming can also lead to a downfall in orchid populations. Other factors contributing to the decline of the orchid include overgrazing, collecting, fire and hay mowing.</li>
					  <li class="mb-2">Prairie potholes are the depressions that remained when glaciers receded from the Midwest 10,000 years ago. These potholes make up part of the seasonal wetlands of the Great Plains. In order to thrive, the Western Prairie Fringed Orchid relies on regular rainfall to maintain these distinctive wetlands.</li>
					  <li class="mb-2">Global warming may threaten this balance by significantly altering the hydrological cycles of the Midwest. Unlike many other parts of the country, climate models indicate that the upper Great Plains may experience an increase in the total amount of preciptation each year. However, while the overall amount may be higher it is predicted that this will be experienced with significant increases in Spring rain, but also increased drought in late Summer. Both the possible Spring flooding and Summer drought could harm the orchid.</li>
				          <li class="mb-2">The drought of the 1980’s significantly reduced flower production and pollination when many of the perennial plants failed to regenerate. As these wetlands begin to dry, invasive plants such as the leafy spurge will crowd the region and eliminate the conditions required for the orchid’s survival.</li>

			    <h2 class="title">	Habitat </h2>
			    <p> Both orchids occur most often in mesic to wet unplowed tallgrass prairies and meadows but have been found in old fields and roadside ditches. The eastern prairie fringed orchid also occurs in bogs, fens, and sedge meadows. Reproduction - The nocturnally fragrant flowers of these perennial orchids attract hawkmoths that feed on nectar and transfer pollen from flower to flower and plant to plant. Seed germination and proper plant growth depend on a symbiotic relationship between the plants' reduced root systems and a soil-inhabiting fungus for proper water uptake and nutrition. </p>

			    <h2 class="title"> Study Area </h2>
                            <p> The study area (52.2 km2) was confined to the Hummock and Swale landform based on a subwatershed within the Pigeon Point – Sheyenne River watershed (hydrologic unit code (HUC) 0902020405). The subwatershed (HUC 090202040503) is defined as a closed basin and was selected based on its central location within the Hummock and Swale landform and groundwater well observations. Also, this subwatershed contained 79% (966) of orchid point data from 2006 to 2012 and all of 2013 orchid points. This allowed for all spatial point and grid data to be spatially defined by the extent of the subwatershed boundaries providing consistency in application of remote sensing indices and analyses. </p>

			    <h2 class="title"> Case Study </h2>
                            <p> The richest and most productive plant communities, including the grasslands typical of the Great Plains, are complex associations of different species dependent on the environment (nutrients and water), as well as ecological connections or relationships with other species. In particular, the mutual benefits of plant– pollinator relationships increase plant reproduction and population growth, increase genetic diversity of individual species, and allow more species to coexist in a plant community, all of which makes a prairie a prairie rather than an admixture of weeds. The diversity of plant species in a grassland is of more than passing interest to rangeland managers because there are clear management benefits to diversity, including increased forage production for livestock and wildlife grazing, improved soil structure, and community resilience to environmental disturbances. Yet, it is easy to overlook the complexity and diversity of pollination relationships of native prairie plants when evaluating long-term management options. Here we argue that the diversity of native grasslands depends on a diversity of pollinators.  </p>
