				    <ul class="mb-5">
					  <li class="mb-2"> Illegal Collectors: Among some particular factors that are putting the species in danger, one of the threats for Rafflesia are the illegal collectors as the plant is widely used as a traditional remedy in Southeast Asia, being prescribed for several internal injuries and also to treat infertility. They usually sell for a hefty price. </li>
                                          <li class="mb-2"> High Mortality Level: The high mortality level of the flower buds is another factor that makes Rafflesia such a rare occurence. In fact, only a small percentage of the flowers are going to bloom and they only last for few days. </li>
                                           <li class="mb-2"> Habitat Specialisation: Rafflesia is a parasitic plant and it only can successfully parasite some particular species. This makes its existence even more difficult because they not only need to have a specific habitat specialisation but a double one. By far, forest destruction is the most significant threat to the existence of the Rafflesia. The rainforest area in SE Asia is threatened as well, thus the natural habitat of the plant is also diminishing. </li>

			    <h2 class="title"> Discovery </h2>
			    <p> The first botanist to find a specimen of a Rafflesia was the French explorer Louis Auguste
Deschamps (1765-1842). He was a member of a French scientific expedition to Asia and the
Pacific. During the expedition he spent three years on Java, where in 1797 he collected a
specimen of what is now known as R. Patma. The British botanist Joseph Arnold (1782-
1818) and the statesman Sir Thomas Stamford Bingley Raffles (1781-1826, founder of
modern Singapore) collected a specimen of another Rafflesia species found by a Malay
servant in Sumatra in 1818. </p>

			    <h2 class="title"> Study Area </h2>
                            <p> Rafflesia is a genus of parasitic flowering plants in the family Rafflesiaceae. It contains approximately 28 species (including four incompletely characterized species as recognized by Willem Meijer in 1997), all found in Southeast Asia, mainly in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. </p>

			    <h2 class="title"> Case Study </h2>
                            <p> While many parasites appear like normal plants, Rafflesia lacks any observable leaves, roots, or even stems (Meijer, 1993). Likened to fungi, Rafflesia individuals grow as thread-like strands of tissue completely embedded within and in intimate contact with surrounding host cells from which nutrients and water are obtained (Mat Salleh, 1996). Perhaps the only part of Rafflesia that is identifiable as distinctly plant-like are the flowers; however, even these are bizarre because they attain massive proportions (up to 3 ft in diameter) and are usually reddish-brown and stink of rotting flesh.. Although parasitic, Rafflesia species do not typically kill their hosts in spite of the drain on resources that they cause. </p>
